# Daily journal template
Provides a very lean set of tools to implement the Agile Daily Journal practice.

## Why is it needed?
I've been using such practices in some of the XP teams I worked with, most of the times finding it very valuable to foster self-reflection and improvement.
While most of the teams who decides to adhere to this practice will likely go for some tool that's more friendly than bare markdown (Discourse is an example), for someone who wants to create journals only for their personal reflection such tools may imply too much setup work.

This template came out of my own need to write daily journals in a painless, searchable and quick way (If I didn't need the searchable paper would have made it)

What this template does, is to automate the creation of a new file, editing, and committing. Very basic, but very time-effective when it comes to repeating these operations every day.
